To solve this problem, we can process each level of the binary tree using a breadth-first traversal (BFS) approach. We calculate the average of the node values at each level and store it in a result array.

Here’s the step-by-step plan:

1. Use a queue to traverse the tree level by level.
2. For each level:
    .Initialize a sum variable to accumulate the values of nodes at that level.
    .Keep track of the number of nodes at that level.
3. After processing all nodes at a level, compute the average and add it to the result array.
4. Continue until all levels are processed.


Explanation:
.queue<TreeNode*> q stores nodes at each level.
.For each level, we iterate over all nodes at that level, summing and counting their values.
.We then calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of nodes at that level and adding it to result.

Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: 
𝑂(𝑛), where 𝑛 is the number of nodes in the tree. We process each node once.

Space Complexity: 
𝑂(𝑚), where 𝑚 is the maximum number of nodes at any level, for the queue.
